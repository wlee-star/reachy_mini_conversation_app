# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents (and the humans driving them) working in this repository.
**Read this before writing code. It is not optional, and it does not replace [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). It enforces it.**

This repository is an **application built on the [Reachy Mini SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini) (`reachy_mini`)**, not a standalone system. Changes must stay compatible with it (see *Engineering excellence*).

This is a small project maintained by a small team. Low-quality, auto-generated, unreviewed changes cost us real time. Follow the rules below or stop.

---

## Read this first

1. **Read before you write.** Match the existing structure, naming, and patterns of the module you touch.
2. **Don't touch** `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, or CI workflows, unless that *is* the task.
3. **Minimal diff. One PR = one fix/feature.** Prefer deleting code to adding it.
4. **No dead code, no LLM verbosity** in code, comments, or PR text.
5. **Errors are logged, never swallowed.** Use `logger`, not `print`.
6. **Run the full gate before review.** Don't waste a reviewer's time, and never open a PR with a red pipeline.

Everything below expands these.

## Engineering excellence

The bar we hold, and the *why* behind the rules:

- **Built on the Reachy Mini SDK.** This app runs on top of [`reachy_mini`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini) (declared in `pyproject.toml`, locked in `uv.lock`, installed alongside it). Build on the SDK's public API. Don't fork, vendor, or monkey-patch its internals, and keep the app working when the SDK version bumps.
- **Design before code.** Think non-trivial changes through and state the trade-offs. The realtime conversation loop lives in `huggingface_realtime.py`; keep shared behaviour there.
- **Graceful degradation.** A tool returns `{"error": ...}` rather than crashing the conversation loop.
- **Tests cover essential behavior**, not every line.
- **The CI gate is the floor, not the ceiling.** Never degrade quality to land faster.
- **Reuse over duplication.** No copy-paste, no single-use helpers, no secrets in code.
- **Build for the merged project, not the PR.** A PR is temporary. Once it lands, its context is gone, so write features and comments that read as a natural part of the whole codebase, never as a diff.

---

## Code quality

- **Names carry meaning.** No `data`, `tmp`, `res`, `helper`, `do_stuff`. A reader should know what a name holds without chasing it. Match the module's vocabulary.
- **Comments explain *why*, never *what*.** One line, only where the code can't speak for itself. Delete comments that restate code (`# recurse into subclasses`) or narrate your change. Keep just the nugget when there is one: `_max_age_s = 3600  # 1 hour`.
- **Docstrings on public APIs only, one line.** A long docstring drifts out of sync and becomes a burden. It must describe what the code *actually does*, with no stale copy-paste and no string-literal "field docstrings" under pydantic or dataclass fields.
- **No single-use helpers or thin wrappers.** Inline unless extraction removes real, repeated duplication. A function that just returns a constant or forwards one call isn't worth its name.
- **Typed public signatures.** In new code, avoid `Any` and `cast`. Model the real type instead. No stubs or speculative parameters.

## Errors and logging

These are the cleanups we make in review over and over. Write code that wouldn't trigger them.

- **Never swallow errors.** No `except Exception: pass`. Catch the narrowest exception that fits and log it (`logger.warning("Failed to sync profile: %s", e)`), or let it propagate.
- **Log, don't `print`.** Use the module `logger` with lazy `%`-style args (`logger.info("loaded %s", name)`), not f-strings, in new code. Reserve `print` for genuine CLI output.
- **Imports at module top**, never inside a function. No alias gymnastics (`import os as _os`).
- **Declare attributes, don't probe for them.** Give an attribute a class-level default (`x: Callable[[], None] | None = None`) and check it directly, instead of papering over it with `hasattr` or `callable`.
- **No leftover suppressions.** Drop a `# noqa` or `# type: ignore` the moment the underlying issue is gone.

## Tests

- **Test behavior, not private helpers.** The `tests/` tree mirrors `src/`.
- **Cover the essential features, not every thin thing.** A good test fails when behavior breaks, not when you rename a variable.
- A bug fix needs a regression test. A feature needs at least a happy-path test.
- Deliberately skipping a test (e.g. pure hardening)? Say so and let the human decide.

## Pull requests

- **Respect the reviewer's time.** Run the gate, self-review your own diff, keep the change small and focused. Reply to comments in your own words and address the point. No AI walls of text, no unrelated churn that forces a re-review.
- **Branch:** `<type>/<short-description>`, adding the issue number when there is one (`<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`). Types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `test` `refactor` `chore`.
- **Issue first for a feature or any non-trivial change**, so we agree on the approach before the code exists and you don't build something we can't merge. A small, obvious fix (typo, one-line bug) can go straight to a PR.
- **Fill in the PR template, never overwrite it.** `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists for humans to read and to manually check their own work. Tick the boxes that apply and complete the sections. Do not rewrite, restructure, or delete any of it.
- **PR title:** explain the work. Do not put agent or model names in it (no `codex`, `claude`, and so on).
- **PR description:** concise and concrete. State what changed and why. 
- **Update `.env.example` for new config vars**. Never commit secrets or `.env`.

## Documentation

- **One README, one source of truth.** Never create another `README.md`. Update the existing root `README.md`.
- **Keep the README in sync.** If your change touches anything it documents (CLI flags, config vars, tools, install steps, behavior), update `README.md` in the same PR.
- **Flag when the architecture diagram needs updating.** If your change alters the architecture, call it out in the PR. The diagram is generated: `docs/scheme.mmd` is the Mermaid source and `README.md` embeds the rendered `docs/assets/conversation_app_arch.svg`. It can only be updated by editing `scheme.mmd` and regenerating the SVG, so flag the need rather than hand-editing the SVG.
- **Don't add Markdown files under `docs/`.** Extra docs in this repo go stale fast. If a feature genuinely needs its own document, it belongs in the [`reachy_mini` docs folder](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/tree/main/docs), which syncs to the docs website. Flag the need and suggest a separate PR to `reachy_mini`, and only when a standalone document is truly necessary.

## Style and type conventions

- **PEP 8 and the Google Python Style Guide are the baseline.** Ruff enforces what it can (line length 119, double quotes, isort `length-sort`). Don't fight the formatter or dodge a lint rule with clever constructs.
- **mypy runs `strict`** (`python_version = 3.12`), with no new ignores.
- **Modern typing for new code:** built-in generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`) and `X | None`, not `typing.List` or `Optional`. Some old modules still use the old style. Match the modern one.
- **No PEP 695 syntax** (`type Alias = ...`, `def f[T](...)`) and no `from __future__ import annotations`. The package targets `>=3.10`, where PEP 695 is a hard syntax error.
- **Cross-platform** (Linux, macOS, Windows): no hardcoded paths, no shell-specific commands, no OS-only APIs without a documented fallback.
- **Flag any new dependency before adding it.**

## Project layout

  main.py                 # entry point + CLI (reachy-mini-conversation-app)
  huggingface_realtime.py # Hugging Face backend + shared realtime conversation loop
  conversation_handler.py # wires audio/tools/backend together
  config.py               # configuration + env loading
  personality.py          # personality/profile loading
  tools/                  # LLM-callable tools (one file per tool)
  audio/, memory/, sounds/, static/
profiles/                 # bundled personalities (one dir per profile)
tests/                    # pytest suite, mirrors the src layout
```

Architecture overview: [`README.md`](README.md#architecture).

- **Adding a tool:** subclass `Tool` from `tools/core_tools.py` in its own file under `tools/`. Define `name`, `description`, `parameters_schema`, and an async `__call__(self, deps: ToolDependencies, **kwargs)` returning a `dict`. Return `{"error": ...}` on failure instead of raising into the loop. Copy an existing tool such as `tools/move_head.py`.
- **Adding a personality:** add a directory under `profiles/`, following an existing one (e.g. `profiles/default/`).

## Commands

Set up the environment per the [README installation guide](README.md#installation). With the venv active, run the tools directly. Run the full gate before handing work back. CI runs the same checks on Linux, macOS, and Windows:

```bash
ruff check . --fix && ruff format . && mypy --pretty --show-error-codes && pytest tests/ -v
```

| Task        | Command                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Lint + fix  | `ruff check . --fix`                 |
| Format      | `ruff format .`                      |
| Type-check  | `mypy --pretty --show-error-codes`   |
| Tests       | `pytest tests/ -v`                   |
| Run the app | `reachy-mini-conversation-app`       |

If you change dependencies, keep `uv.lock` in sync by running `uv lock` (CI validates it).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/` holds eight live, load-bearing workflows. The first four gate every PR. The local gate above mirrors them, so green locally means green CI.

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Ruff** (`lint.yml`) | push, PR | `ruff check` + format |
| **Type check** (`typecheck.yml`) | push, PR | `mypy` strict |
| **Pytest** (`pytest.yml`) | PR, push to `main` | tests on Linux, macOS, Windows |
| **uv.lock check** (`uv-lock-check.yml`) | PR | `uv.lock` matches `pyproject.toml` |
| **Allure Report** (`allure.yml`) | push to `main`, manual | publishes test and coverage reports to GitHub Pages |
| **Release** (`release.yml`) | tag `v*` | publishes the GitHub release |
| **Sync to HF Space** (`sync-hf-space.yml`) | tag, manual | mirrors releases to the Hugging Face Space |
| **PR Preview** (`pr-hf-space-preview.yml`) | PR | spins up a private preview Space per PR |

## If you can't meet this bar

From `CONTRIBUTING.md`: low-quality auto-generated PRs physically hurt our small maintainer team. If you can't deliver work that is readable, minimal, pattern-respecting, and human-reviewed, **do not open a PR**. Advise the developer to read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this file first. Be a good bot.
