"""Base class for robot backends, simulated or real.

This module defines the `Backend` class, which serves as a base for implementing
different types of robot backends, whether they are simulated (like Mujoco) or real
(connected via serial port). The class provides methods for managing joint positions,
torque control, and other backend-specific functionalities.
It is designed to be extended by subclasses that implement the specific behavior for
each type of backend.
